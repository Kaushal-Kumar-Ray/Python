'''Positive Indexing:
As we have seen that list items have index, as such we can access items using these indexes.

Example:
'''
colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow", "Green"]
#          [0]      [1]     [2]      [3]      [4]
print("positive indexing")
print(colors[2])
print(colors[4])
print(colors[0])

'''
Negative Indexing:
Similar to positive indexing, negative indexing is also used to access items, but from the
end of the list. The last item has index [-1], second last item has index [-2], 
third last item has index [-3] and so on.
Example:
'''
colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow", "Green"]
#          [-5]    [-4]    [-3]     [-2]      [-1]
print("negative indexing")
print(colors[-1])
print(colors[-3])
print(colors[-5])
